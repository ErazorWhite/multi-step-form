# Multi-Step Form

This project is a multi-step form application, developed to closely match the provided design, enhancing my skills in React, Formik, and related tools.

## Features

* **Sequential Form Navigation**: Users can complete each step of the form, with the ability to navigate back to previous steps to update selections.
* **Summary and Confirmation**: Users view a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order before submission.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across mobile, and desktop devices.
* **Interactive UI Elements**: Hover and focus states for buttons and inputs provide clear visual feedback for an enhanced user experience.
* **Form Validation**: Instant validation checks for required fields, email format, and selections, ensuring data accuracy throughout the form.


## Demo

1. **Initial State**: Users start with a clean form, with subtle styling and a clear layout, guiding them through each input field.
